PYTHON is a Interpreted Language.
Initially python code is converted to bytecode(not the java bytecode) , which is mostly hidden.

Then these bytecode is send to Python Virtual Machine for execution.

1. Compile to bytecode
    bytecode is a low level code (not machine code, machine code are the direct instructions for hardware) and platform independent.
    bytecode runs faster.
    .pyc -> compiled python(also called frozen binaries)


    __pycache__ -> to organize the frozen binaries

    hello_chai.cpython-312.pyc  -> cpython is a standart python version to build the pyc

    pyc files are only created on :
    -> works only for imported files
    -> not for top level files.




2. PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE (Run time engine)

 -> In pvm a code loop is continuously execution as we feed files to them it executes the code.
 -> PVM also accepts python scripts along with bytecode.
 BYTE CODE is not a machine code it is a python specific interpretation.
 -> cpython,jython,IronPython ,stackless -> python version
